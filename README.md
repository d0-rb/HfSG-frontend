# Dog Duty
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
Dog Duty was made by Henry Castillo, Anh Tran, Sridhar Nandigam, and Christopher Bannon during the <a href = "https://robinhood.engineering/breaking-into-tech-robinhoods-hackathon-for-social-good-6da2291153f5" target="_blank"> Robinhood Hackathon for social good</a> (9/23-9/25 2022).

<p>
Our team focused on environmental goodness during this event, where we narrowed our target focus to 'dog owners'. 
We recognized that people who leave their dog's waste unattended in parks, on trails, or even around apartment complexes, are creating
an adverse environmental impact. We also recognized parks and other places have attempted to solve this solution with physical doggy waste stations.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we decided to create a digital app to complement this attempted physical solution. We wanted to increase the incentive for dog owners
to use the physical waste stations and dispose of their dog's waste properly.
</p>
<p>
Dog Duty would partner with local non-profits, city parks and rec, and apartment complexes to provide prizes or raffles for users to work towards.
Users would recieve up to a certain amount of points a day for throwing away their dog's waste.
</p>

Example workflow:
1. Users would open the app

2. The app would recognize they are nearby a geo-located trashcan (pokemon-go esq)

3. The app would unlock the camera mode because they are nearby

4. The user would take a picture of the trash and upload it

5. Our app would verify it is indeed trash they are throwing away

6. The user would recieve points for the day
